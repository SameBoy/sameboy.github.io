This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* GBS support updated to support common non-standard formats, as well as ugetab's GBS extensions
* ROM and GBS loading errors and handled better in the Cocoa frontend
* SameBoy is now better categorized on Linux desktops
* The Cocoa frontend now includes an optional update checker and installer
* Improved support for running without OpenGL in the SDL frontend, added command-line flag to disable OpenGL
* SameBoy will now attempt to load .snX save states (used by other emulators such as BGB) if a .sX save state is not found
* The Cocoa frontend now has volume control
* The Cocoa and SDL frontends now include an optional speedrun-friendly OSD
* DualSense controllers now have first-tier support in the Cocoa frontend, with rumble, LED, and analog turbo/slow-motion support, in both wireless and USB modes
* The SDL frontend now supports the -s/--stop-debugger command line flag, which starts SameBoy with a stopped debugged on the first instruction
* A new realistic low contrast color correction mode, "Harsh Reality", was added
* Improved the ticks debugger command with more detailed output
* Improved warnings when entering PPU or APU odd-modes
* Major improvements to JoyKit, which should allow previously broken controllers such as Xbox controllers or 8BitDo controllers to work in the Cocoa frontend
* The libretro frontend has been updated to the newer options API, which majorly improves core option screens in RetroArch and other libretro interfaces


### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Improved accuracy of RTC latching
* Fixed a bug that prevented STAT interrupt blocking from functioning correctly in the transition to VBlank while the OAM interrupt was disabled
* Disabled an attempt to improve audio accuracy that resulted in audio regressions in several games
* Improved T-cycle accuracy of VBlank
* Major improvements to emulation of the STOP instruction and speed switching
* MBC5's RAM enable register is now correctly emulated as an 8-bit register
* Improvements to several edge cases of the OAM corruption bug
* Fixed an issue where several DMG games would boot with incorrect palettes when using SameBoy's built-in boot ROMs

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug where the 'O' key could not be mapped in the SDL frontend
* Corrected the default mapping for DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers in the Cocoa frontend
* Fixed a bug that prevented using the Switch Pro Controller in USB mode in the Cocoa frontend
* Fixed a bug where Cocoa's VRAM viewer could appear blurry

### Misc Internal Changes
* The GBS APIs now allow loading from a buffer
* Redundant MBC data removed from BESS save states
