This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* The “Hot Swap Cartridge” functionality now allows hot swapping a file with a newer version of itself in the Cocoa version
  * This can also be done with the new “Reload ROM” menu item, available while holding Shift in the Emulation menu
* The SDL frontend now uses the modern folder selection dialog when selecting a boot ROMs folder on Windows
* Add an option to allow pressing A+B by touching the space between the two buttons in the iOS frontend
* The iOS frontend can now choose between 3 audio modes; Enabled, Disabled, and Controlled by Silent Mode
* The iOS IPA release is now ad-hoc signed to prevent TrollStore from signing it with the wrong entitlements
* The iOS Deb release is now compatible with both rootful and rootless jailbreaks

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Updated the built-in SGB boot ROMs so they're closer in timing to the original boot ROMs

### Bug Fixes
* The Cocoa and iOS versions now display the correct license for SameBoy
* Improved compatibility with certain ISX files
* Fixed the States screen displaying incorrectly in iOS 16 and newer
* Fixed several spelling mistakes in the debugger
* Fixed visual artifacts that may appear in certain scaling filters when scaling with a multiple of 3 factor
* Prevent filtered screenshots from using 64-bit color depth on the Cocoa frontend, which improves compatibility with certain apps
* The `ticks` debugger command no longer outputs “Tick count reset” if the keep flag was used
* Fixed a bug that prevented Turbo Mode from working on iOS if dynamic speed controls were not enabled

### Misc Internal Changes
* Improved integration with libretro's build infrastructure, which should greatly improve the release schedule of the libretro version of SameBoy
