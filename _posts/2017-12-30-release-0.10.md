   * Added scaling filters (requires OpenGL 3.2 support)
   * Added frame blending (requires OpenGL 3.2 support)
 * Added joypad support to both the Cocoa and SDL ports

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes

 * The first frame after turning the LCD on is now skipped, as in hardware (Fixed Pokémon Pinball visual glitch)
 * Accurate emulation of VRAM and OAM blocking
 * More accurate emulation of MBC1
 * Improved serial cable timing emulation
 * Complete rewrite of the APU emulation (Fixed audio on several games)
   * APU emulation is now sample-accurate in almost all case
   * Audio is now rendered at 2MHz (like real hardware), downsampled to 96KHz (or 44.1 on Windows)
