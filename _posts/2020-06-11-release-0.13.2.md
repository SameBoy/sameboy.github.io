This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer.

### New/Improved Features
* The Cocoa debugger now has tab completion
* Conflicting key mappings are now highlighted in red in the Cocoa button configuration dialog
* Improved Dark Mode appearance in the Cocoa port
* Better, more system native appearance for the Cocoa memory viewer
* Improved Printer Feed window in the Cocoa port, now with an option to print with an actual printer

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug in the Libretro frontend that prevented certain achievements from triggering
* Fixed a bug where the save state format effectively used by the Windows build was not following the intended format
* The non-Windows builds can now read pre-0.13.2 Windows save states and vice versa
* Fixed a minor compatibility issue between save states created on 32-bit machines and ones created on 64-bit machines
* Fixed a potential crash when loading certain save states while a printer is connected in the Cocoa port
