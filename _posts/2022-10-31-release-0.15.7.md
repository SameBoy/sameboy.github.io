This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* Debugger inputs in the Cocoa frontend now work if the emulator is paused rather than in debugger-stopped
* The Cocoa debugger was given an improved interface with better contrast, and traditional Continue/Step Over/Step In/Step Out buttons
* The debugger now has an `interrupt` command, in addition to the previously-available ^C key sequence
* SameBoy is now properly categorized as a Game app in macOS's Launchpad
* The `lcd` command now displays the background shifter and fetcher states
* The Cocoa frontend can now perform a "quick reset", which is essentially equivalent to a reset via the cartridge reset pin, and retains RAM values, and other otherwise-uninitialized values
* The Cocoa cheats window is now less strict about forcing a user to type `$` when typing an address
* The `tick` debugger command now has an optional `keep` argument, which prevents resetting the tick count
* Joy-Cons are now fully supported in the Cocoa frontend:
  * This includes the usual pack of zero-configuration key-mappings, rumble support, player LEDs, and motion controls
  * Additionally, a dedicated Joy-Con arrangement sheet lets you combine and separate Joy-Cons and switch their orientation from horizontal to vertical


### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Fixed a regression that made DMA restart timing inaccurate
* Fixed a regression that caused ROMs that trigger one of the pixel insertion glitches to display incorrectly (Release builds) or trigger an assertion (Debug builds)
* Fixed a different regression in a different pixel insertion glitch

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug where the debugger `finish` command did not behave as expected in certain cases where the ROM manipulated the stack
* Fixed a bug that caused the Cocoa cheat window to send debugger commands
* Fixed a regression that caused the Cocoa cheat window to crash when attempting to add an invalid GameShark or GameGenie code
* Fixed a bug that caused the Cocoa cheat window to crash while typing a cheat address on newer versions of macOS

### Misc Internal Changes
* SameBoy (and SameBoot) can now be built with RGBDS 0.6.x; support for RGBDS 0.4.x has been dropped
* Fixed potential compilation warnings for incoming versions of Clang and GCC
* Added the `GB_quick_reset` API
