This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* Improvements to the updater mechanism in the Cocoa port, should handle both Gatekeeper and write permissions better
* The SDL frontend now allows switching between audio drivers, rather than defaulting to the "best" supported driver
* The Windows XAudio2 drivers now use the system's default sample rate, which prevents audio resampling and improves the audio quality

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed SameBoy crashing on launch on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 machines

### Misc Internal Changes
* Fix code signing when locally building release builds of SameBoy on ARM-based Macs
