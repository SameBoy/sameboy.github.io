This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* The "Emulate Hardware" and "Preserve Brightness" color correction modes are now called "Modern – Balanced" and "Modern – Boost Contrast", respectively, to better represent them in the context other modes that came after their introduction
* A new "Modern – Accurate" color correction mode was added. This new mode preserves the modern saturation and contrast of "Modern – Balanced" but further improves on color balancing accuracy
* The Cocoa preferences window now includes help buttons that describe the different Color Correction and High-Pass Filter modes
* Major improvements to the performance of the Cocoa memory viewer
* The Anti-aliased Scale4x filter has been revised and improved

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* A color correction rounding error was fixed

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed potential visual artifacts when using certain scaling filters on some combinations of resolutions and devices
* Fixed a bug that made SameBoy crash on launch on older versions of macOS if an update was available
* Fixed a bug where the Cocoa memory viewer temporarily showed wrong addresses
* The SDL will no longer get stuck (unless "Skip" is used) when trying to use certain joypads' D-pad to configure the directional keys
* Attempt to work around an X11 bug that caused file and directory selection dialogs to ignore mouse keys

### Misc Internal Changes
* The Cocoa memory viewer no longer requires access to internal structures
