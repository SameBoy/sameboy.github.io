This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x.

### New/Improved Features
 * An experimental support for emulating CGB-CPU C is now available in the Cocoa port. This is still experimental and does not accurately represent all differences between CGB-CPU E and CGB-CPU C yet
 * The Libretro port no longer restarts the core after changes to the high-pass filter or color correction
 * The SDL port can now start in fullscreen mode via a command line argument
 * High level emulation of Super Game Boy:
   * Supports game colorization
   * Supports borders, including correct emulation of the fade animations and borders that obscure parts of the Game Boy display window
   * Up to 4-player multiplayer (Currently only in the Cocoa and Libretro ports)
   * Can choose between Super Game Boy (NTSC), Super Game Boy (PAL) and Super Game Boy 2, with correct CPU speed emulation
   * All models include open source boot ROMs, just like previously supported models
   * Includes a default border for games without SGB support
   * Includes a boot animation
   * Accurate emulation of cases where the internal frame buffer loses sync with the SNES/SFC side
 * New CRT display filter
 * New preference panel in the Cocoa port 
 * Minor visual improvements to the icon
 * Many performance all around the core
 * The debugger now includes jump-to breakpoints
 * New APU debugger commands
 * The SDL port now has mouse support
 * The SDL port now has an "Open ROM" dialog window, in addition to the previously available drag and drop support
 * The Cocoa and SDL ports now have better support for sub-frame input accuracy
 * The VRAM display window in the Cocoa port can now display SCX and SCY on the tilemap
 * Redesigned audio API that should improve audio quality in all ports

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
 * WRAM, VRAM, and other types of memory are now realistically initialized to random values. The randomization patterns vary across emulated models and revisions. This fixes several games that rely on non-zero values on boot
 * Slightly more accurate emulation of the undocumented `$FF4C` register, which controls DMG mode on CGBs
 * Fixed an APU regression where the noise channel's volume envelope ran too fast
 * More accurate emulation of analog APU characteristics
 * Fixed a CGB boot ROM bug that made some games boot with incorrect palettes
 * Fixed incorrect emulation of echo RAM
 * Fixed a very rare edge case when an interrupt occurs while the stack points to `$FF11`
 * Correct emulation of the time required to switch the CPU speed
 * Correct emulation of CGB palette accessibility in different PPU timings, fixes Lego Racers
 * Other accuracy improvements to OAM and VRAM accessibility
 * The serial registers now behave realistically by working with bits instead of bytes
 * More accurate initial RAM and VRAM values when using the built in CGB boot ROM
 * Accurate emulation of AGB audio mixing, which is different from older models
 * Fixed the behavior of the wave channel's first sample playback, fixes buzzing sounds on LSDJ and several games
 * Most aspects of STOP mode are now accurately emulated
 * Fixed a bug where initial register values were incorrect when selecting a palette for a DMG game in the built in CGB boot ROM
 * Fixed incorrect emulation of the Background and Window enable bit in LCDC
 
### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed a bug where the SDL port would not recognize joypads if started directly to a ROM
 * Fixed a bug where the Quick Look previewer would show glitched thumbnails for DMG games
 * Fixed a regression that made the Cocoa port unable to display anything on Macs not supporting Metal
 * Fixed a bug where modifying RTC data could corrupt MBC RAM data
 * Fixed a bug where CGB save states were significantly larger than they should have been, older save states are converted
 * Fixed several bugs in expression parsing in the debugger
 * Work around a bug where some Windows 10 machines using Intel HD Graphics had unresponsive UI in the SDL port
 * Fixed a bug where the D-Pad did not work on several gamepads in the Cocoa port
 * Fixed a bug where the gamepad D-Pad had unexpected behaviors in the menus of the SDL port
 * Fixed a bug where underclocking slowed down the core to ~40% of its speed instead of an exact 50%
 
### Misc Internal Changes
 * Rename all Z80 instances to SM83, which is most likely the name of the CPU core used in the Game Boy
 * Size optimization in the CGB boot ROM
