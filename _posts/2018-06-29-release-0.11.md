This version is not compatible with save states of older versions.

### New/Improved Features
 * The Cocoa and SDL ports can now rewind the game using a configurable key
 * The libretro port can now be compiled for Haiku and Wii U
 * The libretro port now has split-screen link cable emulation
 * The Cocoa and SDL ports can now under-clock the emulator for a "slow motion" effect
 * A new LCD screen filter for both the Cocoa and SDL ports
 * The new PPU and timing system introduced an up to 100% performance boost (More details in "Accuracy Improvements/Fixes")
 * A new debugger operator â€“ `{...}` can now be used to dereference a pointer to a 16-bit value
 * Fullscreen support in the SDL port
 * Improved audio in the Windows SDL port, on supported versions of Windows
 * The `delete` and `unwatch` debugger commands are now less strict
 * Added joystick hat support to the SDL port
 * The Cocoa port now uses Metal on supported Macs for better performance on laptops and less capable desktops
 * The Cocoa port now allows specifying a boot ROMs folder, so it can be used with the original boot ROMs
 * Improved the Cocoa debugger, it is now more responsive and no longer truncates output
 * The `lcd` debugger command now shows more accurate details about what the PPU is currently doing
 * The SDL port now has proper joypad configuration, similar to the Cocoa port
 * The SDL port now has more consistent joypad menu navigation, in comparison to keyboard navigation
 * Improved analog stick controls in both ports
 
### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
 * This version introduced major accuracy improvements, making SameBoy able to pass:
   * All of [mooneye-gb's acceptance tests](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb/tree/master/tests/acceptance)
   * All of [Wilbert Pol's tests](https://github.com/wilbertpol/mooneye-gb/tree/master/tests/acceptance)
   * All of Blargg's tests
 * Improved emulation of analog characteristics of the APU for more accurate sound
 * Emulation of an open-bus-like quirk behavior in GDMA and HDMA
 * A whole new T-cycle accurate PPU:
    * Accurate interrupt timing and blocking
    * Sprite timings are now accurate
    * Pixel pushing timing is now accurate, for pixel-perfect emulation of Prehistorik Man
    * Has accurate memory and register access timings
 * Accurate emulation of several timing edge cases related to the `halt` instruction
 * Accurate emulation of a DMA bus quirk on the DMG
 * Complete and accurate emulation of the OAM bug, including cases not tested by Blagg's tests
 * Fixed a regression in dmg_sound-2
 * Several accuracy fixes in SameBoy's built-in boot ROMs
 * DMA now blocks PPU OAM access
 * Correct emulation of wiring both sets of buttons in JOYP
 * Fixed a bug where HDMA and GDMA were 4 times faster than they should have been
 * I/O register access conflicts are now emulated, including behavior differences between models
 * Improved accuracy of the `halt` bug
 * Correct emulation of the DMG `STAT`-write bug, which is just a specific case of I/O register access conflict
 * Emulated an APU glitch where in some edge cases a `DIV`-triggered APU event is skipped

### Bug Fixes
 * Minor text adjustments in both the Cocoa and SDL ports
 * Fixed the Android build of the libretro port
 * The `call` instruction is now properly symbolicated
 * Fixed an issue that caused the Cocoa port to play a beep sound when certain buttons were pressed
 * Fixed several graphical issues with some of the filters
 * Worked around an SDL bug introduced in the macOS port of SDL
 * Fixed a bug where SameBoy froze after leaving turbo mode
 * Fixed a bug where the Windows port could not handle Unicode paths
 * Fixed a bug where the debugger wrote to the wrong CGB RAM bank
 * Fixed a bug where debugging symbols were not properly reloaded
 * Fixed save states in the SDL port
 * Fixed a bug where battery saves were not always saved in the SDL port
 * Fixed a bug where the `SWAP` instruction was incorrectly disassembled as `RLC`
 * Fixed a bug where the Cocoa memory viewer would play a beep sound and show a warning after resetting the emulator
 
### Misc Internal Changes
 * API refinements
 * Minor improvements to the Windows build system
 * Documented several differences between DMG revisions and CGB revisions, and between DMG and MGB. SameBoy now explicitly targets DMG-CPU-B and CGB-CPU-E, and hopefully more revisions in the future
 * The official Windows binaries now use SDL 2.0.8
