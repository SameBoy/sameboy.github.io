This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer.

### New/Improved Features
* Emulation of the unreleased Workboy accessory in the Cocoa port
* Emulation of Game Link Cable and infrared cross-game communication in the Cocoa port
* Multiplayer support in the Libretro core now includes infrared support
* The debugger now supports the `undo` command, which will revert the most recent state-modifying command
* The automatic tester can now optionally output TGA files instead of BMP files
* The debugger will now issue a warning when a ROM triggers PPU odd-mode
* Improved support to non-QWERTY, Latin keyboard layouts in the SDL port
* Simulation of an ambient light's effect on the non-backlit screens of the Game Boy, with user-controlled ambient light color temperature
* Improved menu scrolling in the SDL frontend
* Improved mouse support in the SDL frontend, with mouse wheel scrolling and a visual scrollbar
* The SDL port can now select a boot ROMs folder
* The escape button now returns to the previous menu in the SDL port instead of closing it completely
* Improved noise when emulating the Game Boy Camera on frontends without webcam support
* The SDL port will exit cleanly and report an error if it fails to initialize
* The automatic tester can now optionally create battery save files
* Support of two Real Time Clock emulation modes:
    * Sync to system clock (Not affected by turbo, slow motion, pausing, etc.)
    * Accurate (Affected by the mentioned above)
* The automation uses the new accurate RTC mode for stable results across runs
* Refinements to the icon
* Linux, BSD and other FreeDesktop users can now install SameBoy as both a command line utility and a GUI app by running `make install`

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Emulation of a scenario where an interrupt might trigger OAM corruption
* Emulation of CGB-mode TILE_SEL mixing
* Correct emulation of wave RAM reads when emulating a Game Boy Advance
* Accuracy improvements to infrared
* Accuracy improvements to the window
* Major APU improvements, with correct emulation of countless edge cases and newly discovered quirks:
    * Complete rewrite of Channel 1's sweep envelope
    * Complete rewrite of Channel 4's noise generation, especially mid-pulse writes to NR43
    * Complete rewrite of the volume envelopes, including "Zombie Mode" and related quirks
* The state of the NRx1 registers are now correctly preserved when emulating models prior to Game Boy Color
* Emulation of a quirk where writes to NR44 might be delayed on models prior to Game Boy Color
* Improved and more accurate color correction
* Fixed a regression and improved the accuracy of speed switching, fixed a bug where odd-mode avoidance did not work correctly
* Improved timing of the STOP instruction
* Optional emulation of audio interference from the Game Boy SoC, with a user-controlled slider representing interference level
* Emulation of an APU quirk where triggering Channels 1 and 2 might advance the duty cycle in certain cases in CGB-E (and CGB-D, currently unsupported)
* Correct emulation of the differences between revisions when it comes to writes to NRx2 ("Zombie Mode")
* Accuracy improvements to RTC emulation
* Minor improvements to MBC3 emulation
* Prevent the printer from deadlocking if it was terminated during the transmission of a byte

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a rare potential crash when loading symbol files
* Fixed a bug where the Cocoa port would display wrong, dark, colors when disabling frame blending
* Fixed a bug where the SDL and libretro ports would not update the game's border when switching games and emulating a model other than the SGB
* Fixed cases where the audio thread would deadlock the Cocoa frontend
* Fixed a bug where changing the rewind length in the SDL port didn't take effect until restarting
