This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Improvements to the "Accurate" frame blending option; SameBoy now correctly tracks the "parity" of each frame, and uses a more realistic blending ratio
* Support for bootleg ROMs that claim to have no RAM in the MBC field, but also declare a non-zero RAM size

### Bug Fixes
* Remove XAudio 2.7 support and replace it with the redistributable version of XAudio 2.9, fixing various crashes in Windows 7
* Fixed an issue with the menu graphics being glitches in the SDL frontend if SameBoy is set to display a border
* Fixed the update dialog in the Cocoa frontend displaying the changelog in the wrong font on versions of macOS
* Fixed Quick Look support being broken on macOS Sonoma
* Fixed a bug where the Cocoa and iOS frontend would sometimes flicker when using the Metal renderer
