This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer.

### New/Improved Features
* Prevent SameBoy from asking for notification permissions until that feature is needed by an HuC-3 game
* Improved user interface on macOS Big Sur
* The SDL frontend now has the ability change the default window size

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug that caused the Quick Look previews to include a border on macOS Big Sur
* Fixed a bug where the RTC might drift when loading older saves or states, or when pausing SameBoy for a long time
