This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* A new, fully-featured iOS frontend:
  * Supports every iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch model running iOS 11 or newer (iOS 13 or newer is recommended)
  * Can be installed by side-loading (using [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or [TrollStore](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/)) or using a jailbreak
  * Innovative and customizable touch controls, including support for analog rewind, fast-forward and slow motion
  * Save states
  * Scaling filters
  * In-game rumble support
  * Game Boy Camera support
  * Motion controls for supported games
  * Notifications for alarm-clock-enabled games
  * Advanced emulation settings
  * A lot more!
* Reopening a ROM from Finder or other means now reloads the ROM in the Cocoa frontend
* The SDL frontend received a small facelift
* Cheats support in the SDL frontend
* The SDL frontend can now pick a specific revision from CLI
* A new `reset` command in the debugger, supporting 3 types of resets
* Several new changes that improved performance:
  * Disabled inlining of several slow-path functions
  * Enabled the compiler's fast-math flag
  * Prevention of loop unrolling for large, non-speed-critical loops, to improve utilization of instruction caches
  * Optimize the GUI code for size rather than speed to improve utilization of instruction caches
  * Work around Clang and GCC generating slow code for inline compile-time constants
* Support for ranged breakpoints and watchpoints
* Breakpoints and watchpoints are now identified by a unique ID rather than an address, deletion is now done by ID
* The `IO_` prefix for hardware registers in the debugger has been removed in favor of the more standard `r` prefix
* The Cocoa memory viewer's "Go to" field can now switch banks and address spaces
* The Cocoa memory viewer now symbolicates its selection in the status bar
* The debugger now supports backwards single stepping, if rewinding is enabled (experimental)
* Sending `SIGUSR1` to the SDL frontend now triggers a reset command
* Improved controller assignment in the Cocoa frontend, especially when playing multiplayer SGB games or when emulating the link cable
* Menu and keyboard shortcuts to scale windows up and down to the next integer factor in the Cocoa frontend
* The Windows builds are now 64-bit, greatly improving performance on Windows

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Emulation of open bus behavior when reading disabled cartridge RAM
* More accurate emulation of volume envelope locking on the pre-Color models, as well as CGB revisions older than D
* Improved Printer timings, allowing the mini game in Hello Kitty Pocket Camera to be played
* First-party Nintendo games will now have correct initial register values when using the built-in CGB and AGB boot ROMs
* Improved accuracy of `JOYP` switching delay
* Fixed a timing issue when aborting an object fetch using an `LCDC` write
* Improvements to object fetching address calculation timings
* Accurate emulation of PPU registers write conflicts in CGB double speed mode
* Correct emulation of reading `SVBK`, fixes Flyeyes (unlicensed game)
* Wired Switch Controllers now get automatic button mappings in the Cocoa frontend
* Fixed a bug where GBS files were starting with a wrong value in the `IE` register, fixes several GBS files
* Emulation of the OAM corruption glitch triggered by the `jr` instruction, as well as `halt` and `stop` modes
* Correct read emulation of the `BANK` register while still in the boot ROM
* Fixed a bug where accurate RTC emulation halted while SameBoy wasn't running
* Accurate emulation of many sweep-related glitches, including revision differences
* Fixed a bug where `HDMA5` was not correctly updated when disabling HBlank HDMA
* Correct, revision-accurate emulation of reading from VRAM in the last cycle of Mode 3
* Channel 3 is now correctly mixed when emulating a GBA

### Bug Fixes
* The "Step" icon in the Cocoa debugger was broken on non-Retina displays
* Fixed a bug where certain temperature tint settings would tint too much
* Banked breakpoints no longer trigger while executing the boot ROM
* Fixed camera emulation using the wrong aspect ratio on some Macs
* Fixed a bug that caused artifacts on the right and bottom edges of the Game Boy Camera
* Fixed a bug that allowed rewinding across ROM switches in the SDL frontend
* Fixed a bug that made rewinding try to rewind across model changes
* Fixed a bug that made save states created on Windows incompatible with other operating systems, and vice versa
* Several settings in both the SDL and Cocoa frontends had some unexpected defaults, which have been adjusted
* GameShark cheats were not imported correctly
* Fixed imported cheats not appearing in the Cocoa frontend
* Fixed the built-in MGB boot ROM being unexpectedly larger than it should be
* Prevented cases where the Cocoa debug console would remain open after closing a ROM
* Fixed a bug that caused the Libretro core to crash in link mode
* Fixed support for Xbox Wireless Controllers in the Cocoa frontend
* Some constants in the LCD and CRT filters were not updated when the shaders switched to linear RGB
* Fixed a bug where jump-to breakpoints disassembled the wrong address under certain scenarios
* Fixed an edge case where jump-to breakpoints did not work as expected, or took a slow code path
* Fixes a bug where certain macOS versions would fail to restore the previously opened windows due to a regression in Apple's code
* Fixed a bug that caused the VRAM viewer's toolbar to not appear on macOS Sonoma
* Fixed a bug where controllers did not always automatically connect or reconnect in the SDL frontend

### Misc Internal Changes
* New APIs to explicitly reset the rewind buffer
* When building SameBoy in debug mode, assertions will now make sure functions are always called from a safe thread context
* Fixed an issue that caused the Cocoa preferences window to not open when building on some Macs
* Certain false positive warnings when building with GCC 9 are now avoided
* SameBoy can now be built as a library, allowing to disable certain features as required
* New APU APIs to allow detailed querying of its state
* SameBoy now correctly refers to its license as the Expat License
* Fixed an issue that prevented SameBoy to be built if the repository's path included a space
