This version is a minor bug-fixing version that only affects the SDL version. The macOS version is identical, except for the version number.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed the CGB and AGB boot ROMs being corrupt on the Windows version
* Improved audio quality on the SDL ports on systems using a large audio buffer
