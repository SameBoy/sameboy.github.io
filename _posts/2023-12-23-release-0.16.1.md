This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* SameBoy on iOS will now warn the user if it hasn't been correctly signed, which could prevent "Open With" from working with SameBoy

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Fixed a bug that made SameBoy think a WorkBoy was connected in some cases where a Game Boy Printer was connected

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug that made SameBoy incompatible with macOS versions 10.9 to 10.15
* Fixed several UI issues with the Printer Feed on macOS Big Sur and newer
* Prevent some Cocoa toolbar items from overflowing into a menu item that would crash on click
* Fixed a bug that prevented SameBoy from opening ROM files if VisualBoyAdvance was also installed on macOS
* VSync is now automatically disabled in the SDL frontend if the screen refresh rate is under 60Hz, which could cause garbled audio on some machines
* Fixed a bug where the SDL frontend would indefinitely hang if the current audio device became unavailable while using the XAudio 2.7 driver

### Misc Internal Changes
* The iOS Deb releases no longer contain local file ownership information
* The SDL version used in the Windows release has been updated to 2.28.5
