This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* Scrolling is now smooth when running the SDL port on macOS
* The SDL port's debugger now has a readline-like interface; featuring history, search, auto-complete, text formatting, and improved asynchronous input
  * This also introduces asynchronous debugging to the Windows version
* Minor UI improvements on Big Sur

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Fixed a bug where NR32 was treated as the wrong value after an APU reset
* Writes to wave RAM are now blocked, as expected, when emulating a Game Boy Advance
* Fixed the Game Boy Color and Advance boot ROM not properly initializing wave RAM
* Improved accuracy of mid-line SCX writes, fixes Infinity
* `ld sp, hl` now triggers an OAM corruption on affected models
* Improved emulation of Super Game Boy multiplayer, fixes several games that were not responding to inputs
* Fixed the Super Game Boy `ATTR_SET` command not working correctly, fixing several mis-colored SGB games
* Fixed inaccurate Super Game Boy border fade timing, which caused some games to have corrupt borders
* Fixed inaccurate Super Game Boy graphic transfers, which caused some games to have corrupt borders
* Fixed Super Game Boy rendering of unused tiles, which caused some games to obscure the Game Boy viewport entirely
* Fixed a bug that caused 7-part Super Game Boy commands to lock SGB features, effectively freezing some games on blank screens
* Several timing improvements to the Super Game Boy
* Fixed a mistyped condition that caused a timer glitch to be incorrectly emulated
* Accurate emulation of how the wave channel behaves on restart
* Mostly complete emulation of an APU glitch where channel 3 could read from wave RAM while inactive using the CPU's main address bus on models prior to the Game Boy Advance
* The Game Boy Color and Advance boot ROM animation had its timings slightly altered to better match the original boot ROMs

### Bug Fixes
* A typo was fixed in the debugger `mbc` command
* Fixed a crash in the SDL port that could happen when swapping ROMs
* Handling of tiny (Less than 32KB) ROMs is now more consistent
* Fixed a bug in the SDL port that flipped the controller left and right keys in the menu
* Resetting a game after loading a save state from a different CPU revision now resets the CPU revision to the user-selected revision on the Cocoa port

### Misc Internal Changes
* Fixed an internal struct issue that could have lead to future compatibility issues
* The automatic tester now supports Super Game Boy
