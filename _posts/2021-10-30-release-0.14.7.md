This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator

### New/Improved Features
* The Cocoa frontend now has a built-in screenshot functionality
* The Cocoa palette viewer now uses a monospaced font

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Fixed incorrect emulation of the SVBK register
  * This fixed BESS compatibility issues between SameBoy and other emulators when importing save states of non-Color games on a Game Boy Color and using the original boot ROMs
  * This also fixes RAM not being properly randomized in DMG games running on a Game Boy Color when using the original boot ROMs

### Bug Fixes
* Improvements to stability and security when loading save states
* The SDL port now detects ANSI-incompatible Windows consoles and reverts to the previous behavior
