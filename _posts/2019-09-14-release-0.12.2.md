This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer.

### New/Improved Features
* The Quick Look previewer now produces color-corrected thumbnails
* The debugger now supports a wider range of symbol files

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Fixed a bug where samples in the wave channel were treated as if they're 0, effectively muting the channel in some cases.
* Fixed a regression that caused some PPU test ROMs to fail
* More accurate emulation of memory access conflicts on the Super Game Boy
* When emulation a Super Game Boy, built-in palettes for select games are now emulated
* Accuracy improvements to Super Game Boy's multiplayer mode
* Super Game Boy and Game Boy Advance now have their own color correction filters

### Bug Fixes
* Improvements to audio in the SDL port, affecting some machines
* Fixed a bug where the SDL port loaded the wrong boot ROM when emulating Super Game Boy 2
* Fixed broken audio on libretro when used with some RetroArch audio drivers
* Fixed a potential crash when closing a window in the Cocoa port
* Fixed libretro achievements
* Fixed major performence issues in the Cocoa port that affected some Macs, especially when emulating the original Super Game Boy

### Misc Internal Changes
* The emulation core now supports emulating a Super Game Boy without high level emulation of the SNES or SFC. SameBoy is now used for Game Boy emulation by [bsnes](https://bsnes.byuu.org), allowing extremely accurate low-level emulation of Super Game Boy.
* Made it possible to compile the SDL port with older SDL versions
* Compression improvements to the CGB and AGB boot ROMs
