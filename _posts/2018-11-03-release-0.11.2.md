### New/Improved Features
 * Each debug console in Cocoa now displays the ROM file name in its titlebar
 * SameBoy can now load RTC information from battery saves from different emulators including BGB, VisualBoyAdvance, and VisualBoyAdvance-M and vice versa. Older battery saves will automatically be converted

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
 * More accurate emulation of DAC charging and discharging. Fixes the buzzing sound heard in several games
 * Fixed a bug where the left and right audio channel were swapped
 * More accurate GDMA and HDMA timings
 * Fixed several bugs, one of which is a regression, where channels 1 and 2 could play without a delay. Fixes missing audio in Gensan 2
 * Correct emulation of enabling and disabling the volume envelope
 * Correct emulation of a glitch where the volume envelope ticks when it usually wouldnâ€™t
 * Compensate for CPU prefetch in DIV's initial value
 * Correct emulation of turning the DACs on and off. Fixes missing audio in several games
 
 
### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed bugs in the debugger UI in Cocoa that made it unresponsive
 * Fixed a bug where the libretro core didn't save and load the RTC properly
