### New/Improved Features
 * Conditional r/w/rw debugger watchpoints
 * Added the "!=" operator to the debugger
 * Redefined the debugger input and output syntax, being more consistent with RGBDS
 * Debugger now reads .sym files (Tested with 3 popular formats). It shows symbols when possible, and allows using them in expressions
 * Debugger data types can now be either 16-bit values, or 25-bit full addresses that include a bank identifier
 * Debugger commands and expressions support full addresses as parameters. This allows, for example, breaking on an address on a specific ROM bank, or reading a value from a specific MBC RAM bank.
 * Some debugger commands may now run without breaking the debugger. (Similar to LLDB or GDB's async mode)
 * SDL port now supports save states
 * Improved performance by about 6% by enabling link-time optimizations
 * Reduced file size by stripping executables
 * Several Cocoa-only UX improvements:
   * Prevented being paused "twice" (Both by the pause option and the debugger)
   * Optional proportional resizing
   * Proper fullscreen support
   * Mouse cursor is now hidden while running

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
This version includes major accuracy improvements, which allow it to pass 54 tests out of [mooneye-gb](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb)'s 58 acceptance tests (2 of which fail due to not including the original boot ROM); more than any other emulator.

 * Rewritten MBC support, with MBC1M support (Fixing some N-in-1 cartridges)
 * Major accuracy improvements to OAM DMA.
 * Corrected a lot of instruction memory-access timings
 * Corrected some IO register masks
 * Major accuracy improvements to timers (TIMA/DIV)

### Bug Fixes
 * Corrected operator priorities in the debugger
 * Fixed a bug where a breakpoint might have been ignored
 * Reduced CPU usage when running games with a real time clock
 * Handling ^C and ^D more sanely in SDL port
 * Fixed memory leak in Cocoa

### Misc Internal Changes
 * Added infrared API, but it is not actually used by any of the GUIs
 * Fixed build system bugs that caused needless dep file generation, and made the Cocoa build fail sometimes if SDL is not installed
