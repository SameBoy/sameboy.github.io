This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer.

### New/Improved Features
* When emulating a Game Boy, you can now select out of 4 different palettes
* New Monochrome LCD scaling filter
* It is now possible to display Super Game Boy, or a built-in default border, even when emulating different models
* Improvements to the built-in boot ROMs; the DMG boot ROM has a new animation, and the CGB boot ROM now features an anti-aliased logo
* Gamma correction added to the CRT scaling filter
* Add "Reduce Contrast" as an additional color correction mode
* Optional more accurate frame blending mode, emulating the scanline-like appearance of actual Game Boy displays
* The `next` debugger command now skips over HALT
* The `registers` debugger command now display IME as well
* Added volume control to the SDL frontend
* The SDL frontend will now load and save "prefs.bin" relative to the binary if such file exists
* The sidebar in the Cocoa debugger is now resizable and collapsable
* The Cocoa frontend now supports cheats
* Added support to ISX files, used by the official toolchain
* Rewritten and improved controller support in Cocoa, featuring rumble, player LEDs, and analog controls for turbo and slow motion. Controller support:
  * GameCube adapters (Both official and PC adapters): Full support, including automatic mappings, multiplayer, analog controls, and rumble
    * Unofficial adapters in PC mode support analog rumble, as opposed to PWM binary rumble; the use of PC mode is recommended
  * Generic "Twin USB" DualShock 2 PC adapter: Automatic mapping, multiplayer support
  * Switch Pro Controller: Full support, including automatic mappings, rumble, and player LEDs; via both USB and Bluetooth
  * DualShock 3: Full support, including automatic mappings, rumble, player LEDs, and analog controls; via both USB and Bluetooth
    * Some Macs seem to be unable to communicate LED and rumble information to DualShock 3 controllers; the use of USB for this controller is recommended
  * Generic controllers: Basic functionality, may need to be manually remapped in settings
  * Support for more controllers will come in future releases
* Optionally add rumble support to all games, even those without a Rumble Pak, in all frontends
  * SDL rumble support varies between operating systems and SDL versions
* The debugger now allows more than one symbol at the same address
* Added the `softbreak` debugger command to enable/disable software breakpoints (`ld b, b`)
* The SDL debugger now always outputs ">" when it's waiting for an input
* The SDL debugger allows the use of the magic binary sequence `"\x03\x0a"` to break the debugger from stdin in async-capable platforms

### Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
* Fixed a regression bug that made the first frame blank instead of repeated on the Game Boy Color
* Fixed an APU sequencer edge case
* Fixed a bug affecting HDMA timing
* Color correction is now more accurate
* Correct emulation of the OPRI register
* More accurate emulation of STOP mode
* More accurate emulation of LCDC write conflicts; although individual units may behave differently
* Emulation of cases where PPU object fetched are aborted in the middle
* Correct emulation of changing object height during fetch
* More accurate emulation of the PPU fetcher's timings
* Accurate emulation of SCX's upper 5 bits changing mid-line
* Rewritten window implementation, which is much more accurate now, including the various timing scenarios
* More accurate emulation of background FIFO push timings
* Emulate some of the cases where the PPU and LCD desync
* Accurate emulation of tilemap advance timings
* Implement a missing SGB command (ATTR_CHR)
* More accurate MBC2 emulation
* More accurate MBC3 emulation and proper MBC30 support
* Correct emulation of PCM12 and PCM34 reads when emulating CGB-C
* Improved HuC-1 emulation
* HuC-3 emulation, including RTC and alarm clock emulation
  * Alarm clock emulation is only supported in the Cocoa frontend
* Partial emulation of glitched VRAM reads that happen right after mode 3

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug with scrolling menus in the SDL frontend when emulating a Super Game Boy
* Fixed cases where the Cocoa frontend froze
* Fixed a bug where an incorrect minimum window size was enforced on the Cocoa frontend
* Assignments to 16-bit expression in the debugger is now working correctly
* Fixed operator priorities in the debugger
* Fixed a debugger parsing bug
* Fixed compatibility with older macOS versions in the Cocoa version, restoring support for 10.9 (Mavericks) and newer

### Misc Internal Changes
* Added per-commit automatic GitHub builds, with basic sanity tests
* When building the SDL frontend on macOS, the Brew version of SDL2 is used
* Fixed various compilation errors with GCC
* Make the libretro frontend compile without warnings
* HuC-1 and HuC-3 IR are emulated now, but this is not currently supported in any frontend
