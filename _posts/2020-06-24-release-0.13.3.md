This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.11.x and newer.

### New/Improved Features
* The scaling filters were updated to use gamma-corrected color mixing, improving the quality of all shaders, especially the LCD and CRT shaders.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a regression in the CGB and AGB boot ROMs where wrong palettes were chosed for Nintendo DMG games.
