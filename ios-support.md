## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I play games?

To play a game on SameBoy for iOS you must first import a ROM file into the app. This can be done in several ways:

1. Download a GB or GBC ROM file in your device's web browser, and tab the downloaded file once the download is complete. 
2. Open the Files app, and open a GB or GBC ROM file. 
3. Tap the Game Boy screen in SameBoy and choose “Library”. Tap “Import ROM files” and select one or more GB or GBC ROM files you wish to import.
4. AirDrop a GB or GBC ROM file from a Mac or another iOS device

If SameBoy does not automatically open and play your game, you might need to choose “Open in SameBoy”.

### How do I fast-forward/turbo?

You can fast forward the game by swiping right on the Game Boy screen. To change the turbo speed, tap the Game Boy screen and choose “Settings”, “Emulation”. You can also change turbo behavior to Locking, or enable Dynamic Speed Controls under “Settings”, “Controls”.

### How do save and load save state?

Tap the Game Boy screen and choose “States”. Tap an empty slot to save a save state, or tap an in-use slot to choose between loading it or overwriting it with a new state.

You can also enable gesture controls under “Settings”, “Controls” – swipe down on the Game Boy screen to save to Slot 1, or swipe up to load from Slot 1.

### Can I play Game Boy Advance games on SameBoy?

No, SameBoy can only emulate a Game Boy Advance running in Game Boy Color compatibility mode, and cannot play Game Boy Advance game. You can play games made for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Super Game Boy.
